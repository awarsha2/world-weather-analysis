## Project Overview:
Work with google maps and OpenWeatherMaps API to see potential for travel app development. Includes finding potential destinations via coordinates, search for city names, results criteria filtering, hotel research, map creation, and mock travel itineraries. 

## Summary:
APIs are versatile and work well, but no UIs were tested. In conclusion: potential for future development.
